Why it matches the Dynoverb plugin color scheme:
-----------------------------------------------
The Dynoverb plugin uses a blue-purple color scheme with cyan accents for freeze:
- Primary accent: Blue-purple (#6b8cff)
- Secondary: Purple (#9b6bff)
- Freeze color: Cyan (#00d4ff)
- LED: Blue-ish (#6b8cff)
- Background: Dark (#1a1a1a)

This twilight sky image features:
- Purple and blue gradients that match the reverb plugin's ethereal aesthetic
- Cyan hints in the lighter portions that align with the freeze function color
- Atmospheric quality that evokes the reverb's spacious sound character
- Brazilian evening sky aesthetic (tropical twilight ambiance)

Recommended usage:
- Apply with low opacity (10-15%) as a subtle background texture
- The gradient naturally flows from darker bottom to lighter top
- Complements the decay visualizer and reverb tail graphics
- Enhances the "infinite reverb" / freeze feature aesthetic
